## Small (sinatra){http://www.sinatrarb.com] webserver powered by (puma)[http://puma.io] 

I created this sintra app to make Cappuccino apps easy to deploy  on Heroku.

1.) Clone this repo into your local disk
2.) 'bundle install'
3.) copy the content of your Deploy folder in public directory - the route to index.html must be public/index.html otherwise you need to change the server.rb accordingly
4.) 'rackup config.ru'
5.) commit your work, create an app on Heroku and push.

I added a sample index.html file in the public, so you can test the app copy anything in public.
